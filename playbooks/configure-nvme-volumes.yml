- name: Format and mount additional ebs volumes on ec2 after the instance launched (NVMe version).
    AWS does not allow you to specify NVMe device names in the block device mapping, and the block device driver in
    the OS can assign NVMe device names in a different order than you specified for the volumes in the block device mapping, 
    so this is a little different than the XVDx version.
